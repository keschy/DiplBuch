What is media technology? What will be taught on the secondary college for\\ engineering?\\ These questions trouble students that want to apply to our school. With their only chance to inform themselves at the open day, they discover that only three parts of media technology are shown, photography, video and audio. The remaining parts like web design, software engineering and web technology are either mentioned very briefly or not mentioned at all. The problem is that students apply for our school but discover that the focus lies on programming. To counteract, we developed a web platform which enables students to inform themselves about media technology. The website offers an insight into our school with videos and interactive elements. The interviews answer important questions about the school in general and the department media technology. The user also gets the chance to view and try elements that are taught in school. Interactive elements play a big role as they make students curious but also makes them focus on the subjects that are being taught.
